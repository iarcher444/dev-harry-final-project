# Customize Your Pizza 🍕

For the dev-harry-final-project, I have made a "Customize Your Pizza" app. It is a web-based application that allows users to easily create a pizza that they'd like to order. This app is built for responsiveness and interactivity as to give customers an enjoyable experience no matter the device they use.

Features of this app:
- 🧑‍🍳 Customizable Options: Lets you choose your crust, size, toppings, and cheese level.
- 📱 Mobile-Friendly Design: Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes.
- 📋 Dynamic Data: Loads default pizza configurations from a data object and allows modifications.
- 💾 Live Data Preview: Lets you see your updated pizza configuration dynamically in the app.
- 🔄 Clean Interface: Uses modern web technologies for a clean look.
